Microsoft Drive Optimizer
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corp.

Description:

        Optimizes and defragments files on local volumes to
        improve system performance.

Syntax:

        defrag <volumes> | /C | /E <volumes> [<task(s)>] [/H] [/M [n] | [/U] [/V]] [/I n]

        Where <task(s)> is omitted (traditional defrag), or as follows:
                /A | [/D] [/K] [/L] | /O | /X

        Or, to track an operation already in progress on a volume:
        defrag <volume> /T

Parameters:

        Value   Description
        /A      Perform analysis on the specified volumes.
        /C      Perform the operation on all volumes.
        /D      Perform traditional defrag (this is the default).  On a tiered volume
                though, traditional defrag is performed only on the Capacity tier.
        /E      Perform the operation on all volumes except those specified.
        /G      Optimize the storage tiers on the specified volumes.
        /H      Run the operation at normal priority (default is low).
        /I n    Tier optimization would run for at most n seconds on each volume.
        /K      Perform slab consolidation on the specified volumes.
        /L      Perform retrim on the specified volumes.
        /M [n]  Run the operation on each volume in parallel in the background.
                At most n threads optimize the storage tiers in parallel.
        /O      Perform the proper optimization for each media type.
        /T      Track an operation already in progress on the specified volume.
        /U      Print the progress of the operation on the screen.
        /V      Print verbose output containing the fragmentation statistics.
        /X      Perform free space consolidation on the specified volumes.

Examples:

        defrag C: /U /V
        defrag C: D: /M
        defrag C:\mountpoint /A /U
        defrag /C /H /V

The syntax of this command is:

WHERE [/R dir] [/Q] [/F] [/T] pattern...

Description:
    Displays the location of files that match the search pattern.
    By default, the search is done along the current directory and
    in the paths specified by the PATH environment variable.

Parameter List:
    /R       Recursively searches and displays the files that match the
             given pattern starting from the specified directory.

    /Q       Returns only the exit code, without displaying the list
             of matched files. (Quiet mode)

    /F       Displays the matched filename in double quotes.

    /T       Displays the file size, last modified date and time for all
             matched files.

    pattern  Specifies the search pattern for the files to match.
             Wildcards * and ? can be used in the pattern. The
             "$env:pattern" and "path:pattern" formats can also be
             specified, where "env" is an environment variable and
             the search is done in the specified paths of the "env"
             environment variable. These formats should not be used
             with /R. The search is also done by appending the
             extensions of the PATHEXT variable to the pattern.

     /?      Displays this help message.

  NOTE: The tool returns an error level of 0 if the search is
        successful, of 1 if the search is unsuccessful and
        of 2 for failures or errors.

Examples:
    WHERE /?
    WHERE myfilename1 myfile????.*
    WHERE $windir:*.*
    WHERE /R c:\windows *.exe *.dll *.bat
    WHERE /Q ??.???
    WHERE "c:\windows;c:\windows\system32:*.dll"
    WHERE /F /T *.dll

    /a         Abort a system shutdown.
               This can only be used during the time-out period.
               Combine with /fw to clear any pending boots to firmware.
    /p         Turn off the local computer with no time-out or warning.
               Can be used with /d and /f options.
    /h         Hibernate the local computer.
               Can be used with the /f option.
    /hybrid    Performs a shutdown of the computer and prepares it for fast startup.
               Must be used with /s option.
    /fw        Combine with a shutdown option to cause the next boot to go to the
               firmware user interface.
    /e         Document the reason for an unexpected shutdown of a computer.
    /o         Go to the advanced boot options menu and restart the computer.
               Must be used with /r option.
    /m \\computer Specify the target computer.
    /t xxx     Set the time-out period before shutdown to xxx seconds.
               The valid range is 0-315360000 (10 years), with a default of 30.
               If the timeout period is greater than 0, the /f parameter is
               implied.
    /c "comment" Comment on the reason for the restart or shutdown.
               Maximum of 512 characters allowed.
    /f         Force running applications to close without forewarning users.
               The /f parameter is implied when a value greater than 0 is
               specified for the /t parameter.
    /d [p|u:]xx:yy  Provide the reason for the restart or shutdown.
               p indicates that the restart or shutdown is planned.
               u indicates that the reason is user defined.
               If neither p nor u is specified the restart or shutdown is
               unplanned.
               xx is the major reason number (positive integer less than 256).
               yy is the minor reason number (positive integer less than 65536).
